# Languages, Operating Systems, and Networks

"The three biggest advancements in computers: languages, operating
systems, and networks" ~ Ken Thompson

TIL John McCarthy was a big part in time-sharing systems.

Infamous Bugs

* Ariane 5: rocket explodes; overflow; $500M
* USS Yorktown: zero entry leaves dead in in water
* Near Nuclear War: Oct. 5, 1960 Early Warning System mistakes moon for missle attack
* Pentium FDIV error: $475M
* Denver Baggage System: $1.1/day for over 9 months
* Therac-25 radiotherapy: multiple deaths

TIL the original version of Unix only had 20 system calls and they still
exist amongst the 1000s of system calls in its descendant, Linux. Though
there is no resource I have found that states the original 20, the
closest thing I could find was the first edition "Unix Programmer's
Manual".

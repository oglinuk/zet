# Making Good Habits

For almost 2 years I have been following a person named `rwxrob`, who has
exposed me to not only many awesome topics, but also a lot of awesome
people. One of his things is the *rwx (read, write, execute) method*. To
best learn, one should apply all three. I often read and execute, but am
very bad at writing. Using `cmd-zet` and maintaining my own zet is my
first step towards better habits with writing.

Not only three different languages (pseudocode, java, c++) covering
data structures and algorithms, but links to other related projects.

Thank you **Pat Morin**.

"Open Data Structures covers the implementation and analysis of data
structures for sequences (lists), queues, priority queues, unordered
dictionaries, ordered dictionaries, and graphs.

Data structures presented in the book include stacks, queues, deques, and
lists implemented as arrays and linked-lists; space-efficient
implementations of lists; skip lists; hash tables and hash codes; binary
search trees including treaps, scapegoat trees, and red-black trees;
integer searching structures including binary tries, x-fast tries, and
y-fast tries; heaps, including implicit binary heaps and randomized
meldable heaps; graphs, including adjacency matrix and ajacency list
representations; and B-trees.

The data structures in this book are all fast, practical, and have
provably good running times. All data structures are rigorously analyzed
and implemented in Java and C++. The Java implementations implement the
corresponding interfaces in the Java Collections Framework.

The book and accompanying source code are free (libre and gratis) and are

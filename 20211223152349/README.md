# Open Source Games

DOOM and Quake are the most iconic classics for various reasons in my
opinion. One of the best reasons is that their engine source code was
made open source. Not only did a large company like steam use the open
source engines, but the game communities also picked up the public code
and made their own source ports.

It is important to remember that a game has two core components: the game
engine, and the game data or assets.

In the case of DOOM or Quake, the *game engine* is the only thing that
was made open source. The *game content* is still required to be
purchased. What this means is that you only have to legally purchase the
game once (can get from gog.com) to obtain the game data.

A game like Unvanquished however, is entirely free and open source (both
engine and game data).

I compiled a list of games that I found enjoyable, and was able to
compile from source rather than relying on a pre-compiled binary.

# TIL Periph

"Periph is a standalone hardware library with limited external
dependencies."

What an awesome find from spelunking! I am particularly interested in the
package `bootstrap`, as it has "a tool to flash an OS to a SDCard, an OS
that will automatically set itself up upon first boot" and "a tool to
cross compile and push Go executables seamlessly to a Raspberry Pi or any
other host accessible via ssh."

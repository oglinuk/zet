# Defining Success in IT

You may or may not have heard of a tool called `ngrok`. If you have not,
a quick overview is it allows you to expose your `localhost` to the
internet behind NATs and firewalls. Understanding why this is useful is
beyond the scope of this zet.

My first exposure to ngrok was back in 2018, but I never did anything
more than a "hello, world!" example. While learning about creating GitHub
webhooks, I came across the suggestion of the *use of ngrok*! This made
something click for me in terms of what defines success in a software
context.

Why is Windows the most commonly used operating system? The answer is
because they got *others to use/talk about it*. The key thing is not just
that others use something, but that they also *talk about the
something*.

What made this really click for me was when I went to look for an ngrok
developer blog, and the the *top 8 search results from duckduckgo were
all blogs (some from large enterprises like Atlassian, AWS, and
Microsoft) of developers using ngrok.* I have included those blogs in the
related section below.

***Success in an IT context is mass adoption and discussion.***

# Rust-lang Issue of the Day #0

```
Rust user #1 - "Quite some time back, we changed 'compile_and_link' to
'oxidize' (#12126). Iâ€™ve given up counting the number of people that have
been confused by it and wasted time trying to find out what it means. It
was a bit of fun that is, unfortunately, actively making things harder
for people. Can we please change it back to 'compile_and_link'?"

Rust user #2 - "I like oxidize, don't want it to be changed. For
developers who compile rust itself, it's easy to understand what oxidize
means. Even if he cannot understand, it doesn't matter."
```

Definiton of *oxidize* (according to merriam webster)

```
1 : to combine with oxygen
2 : to dehydrogenate especially by the action of oxygen
3 : to change (a compound) by increasing the proportion of the
electronegative part or change (an element or ion) from a lower to a
higher positive valence
```

```
Non-Rust user - "I'm confused."
```

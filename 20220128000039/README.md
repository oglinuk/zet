# `TIL` OpenGL came before DirectX

A recent zet by rwxrob claiming "Microsoft
pioneered modern 3D desktop applications (DirectX)" made me wonder if
that was actually true.

Turns out, OpenGL came out 2 years before DirectX.

I found a post stating "It was quite a battle between the david and the
goliath. Microsoft used their finance to win the developer, while SGI
used their reputation and technical experience. The "David" gained
support from a legendary 3D game creator: John Carmack, the developer of
Doom and Quake engine. Even then, he stated that Direct3D was not
developer friendly and encourage others to start using OpenGL."

While I agree that the majority of the market is still using DirectX,
I strongly believe Linux is still capable of contending if developers
took the time to make games cross platform. As proof you can still the
original Doom and Quake (on any platform) right now using chocolate-doom
for Doom or darkplaces for Quake. I've put links to the projects below
and will write zets about how to use them.
